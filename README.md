## How to use?

1. Install the package using npm

```
npm install rerousel
```

2. Import rerousel in the component you want to use it

```tsx
import { Rerousel } from 'rerousel';
```

3. Place it in the desired position and fill it with the items you want to showcase

```tsx
export const Component: React.FC<CustomersProps> = ({ customers }) => {
    const customerLogo = useRef(null);

    return (
        <Container>
            <Rerousel itemRef={customerLogo}>
                {customers.map((c) => {
                    return <Img key={c.image} image={c.image} ref={customerLogo} />;
                })}
            </Rerousel>
        </Container>
    );
};
```

4. Create a ref pointing at your outermost item inside of the rerousel and include it in the Rerousel as **"itemRef"** prop.
   You can also determine the interval using **"interval"** prop in **milliseconds**, but you don't have to - default value is **3 seconds**.

## Props

| Prop         | Type                     | Default     | Required? | Description                                                                                   |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | ----------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **itemRef**  | _RefObject<HTMLElement>_ | `undefined` | Yes       | Reference to the outermost item of carousel - used to retrieve information about item's width |
| **interval** | _Number_                 | `3000`      | No        | Interval length in milliseconds                                                               |
| **stop**     | _Boolean_                | `false`     | No        | Should the carousel stop?                                                                     |
